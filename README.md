> **Note**: there is no guarantee that this is secure and definitely requires extensive security testing before it can be used in production settings. For now, you should probably just use [AWS KMS](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/kms/). This is meant as a final resort for a private repository, such that you have time to change your passwords if the data is accidentally made public. Make sure you are changing your passwords at most every 3 months.

## What is it

**Pass-It-On** is a password manager for:

- Giving password access to multiple users
  - Uses LABELs or USER GROUPS (i.e. sets of users who can use the same **keys** or **secrets**)
- Allows you to store your keys in a code repository
- Automatic retrieval at server start for autoscaling purposes

## How it works

### Unlocking Group Level Keys

> Encrypting the access keys

- **Add**:
  - *ADMIN* fetches a public or private key
  - Encrypts with user's public key
  - **Append**: `json.item_name = "key_encrypted_by_password"`
    - Password is salted and hashed using PBKDF2
      - **Fernet**: encrypts user's private key using hash
- **Remove**:
  - `delete json.item_name`

### Unlocking Keys as GROUP

> Accessing the passwords, themselves

Types:

- Read: private key
- Write: public keys

Locked with **GPG**

### ADMIN user

> A user that has read and write privileges of everything

- Add user
- Create group
- Delete user
- List groups
- List users

### Other Users

- Access available keys
  - Read passwords
  - Write password

## Usage

Modes:

1. Administration
2. Injection

### 1. Administration

> A mode where you manage the password store

#### Functions:

* Initialize store
* Add user to group
* Create new group
* Add keys to group
* Add / Modify / Delete users
* Add / Modify / Delete / List keys
* Change passwords

#### Authentication

1. Run the application
2. Enter username and password
3. Choose options available to that user

### 2. Injection

> Run this inside your application and the passwords you have been authorized access to will be injected into the development environment

There are two ways of being authenticated in *injection mode*:

1. Putting your username and password inside `PIO_USER` and `PIO_PASS`, respectively.
2. Following the prompt.

##TODO

- [ ] fix store.js
- [ ] test cases: `npm test` fails ðŸ˜¥
- [ ] command line commands (`pio.js`)
- [ ] Teach Kemal how to do config and env variables file
- [ ] operations: removeSecret, deleteSecret, addSecretToGroup
- [ ] figure out grouping stuff
- [ ] make `Auth` version of public-facing functions to auto-decrypt pub/priv keys because operations should be only thing that talks to security
- [ ] is it ok that `store.json` is ignored?
